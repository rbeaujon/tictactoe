# TIC TAC TOE (noughts and crosses)

This is a game created from scratch by me.
It's based and inspired by the popular game Tic Tac Toe (noughts and crosses) used by MIT students to demonstrate the power of the Tinkertoy computer in 1975<p>
But the game has a longer history than that and can be traced back to ancient Egypt or Rome Empire.

## Let's go to play

It's a game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O.  
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, is the winner.
