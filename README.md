# TIC TAC TOE (noughts and crosses)

This is a game created from scratch by me.
It's based and inspired by the popular game Tic Tac Toe (noughts and crosses)<p>
This game has a long history and can be traced back to the ancient Egypt or Rome Empire. 


## Let's go to play

It's a game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O<p>  
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row<p>  
is the winner.
